# C Script Repository

Welcome to the C Script Repository! This repository contains a collection of C scripts and files, each designed to demonstrate different aspects of C programming. Below is an overview of each file in this repository.

## Files:

1. **0x00-hello_world.c**: A simple C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. **0-preprocessor.c**: Demonstrates the use of the C preprocessor to manipulate code before compilation.

3. **1-compiler.c**: Illustrates how to compile C code using a C compiler.

4. **2-assembler.c**: Demonstrates the process of assembling C code into assembly language.

5. **3-name.c**: Contains a basic C program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from.

6. **4-puts.c**: A C program that uses the `puts` function to print a message.

7. **5-printf.c**: Shows the usage of the `printf` function to format and print text.

8. **6-size.c**: A C program that prints the size of various data types on the current platform.

9. **100-intel.asm**: Contains assembly code written in Intel syntax.

10. **101-quote.c**: A C program that prints a specific message using the `write` system call.

11. **a.out**: This is the default output file generated when you compile a C program.

12. **quote**: The binary executable for the `101-quote.c` program.

## Usage:

To compile and run these C programs, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the desired script's directory in your terminal.

2. Compile the C program using a C compiler like `gcc`. For example, to compile `0x00-hello_world.c`, use the following command:

   ```bash
   gcc -o hello_world 0x00-hello_world.c
